## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Use the margin: auto, to center the card in the window.

```css
  .card {
      height: 490px;
      width: 320px;
      background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      margin: auto;
      border-radius: 10px;
      box-shadow: 0 15px 20px 1px hsl(212, 45%, 79%);
    }
```

### Continued development

Now I need to start to involve JavaScript for the website design. Need to practice BEM.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - good resource for CSS instructions and examples.
